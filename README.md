# SearchWordXLS2XLS
The code first prompts the user to select an Excel file containing search words. It reads the contents of the first column of the selected worksheet into a list of search words. It then prompts the user to select a folder to search in. For each search word, it searches for files in the selected folder whose names contain the search word. For each found file, it creates a record in a new row in an output Excel sheet containing the search word and the file path. The output Excel sheet is created using xlwt.Workbook(), and a new worksheet called "Results" is added to it. The search word and file path for each found file are written to this worksheet using output_worksheet.write(). Finally, the output Excel sheet is saved to a file selected by the user using output_workbook.save(), and a success message is displayed.
